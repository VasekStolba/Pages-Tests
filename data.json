Case [T-23-0009](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ayP5KkdW9XLUcyNzUYsrH0-G4vEDi-lDrHu0HBlCDaQ/edit \"‌\") from 4th February 2024. The sentence was a traffic warning. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Careless Driving, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, Section 3 § 1(b); Class B traffic infraction\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Does the Foundation Code, title II., subsections 3 § 1(a) and (b), define driving in the prescribed manner as criminal even if there are no other vehicles or pedestrians nearby that could be affected by such conduct?\n2. Is driving backwards careless driving, as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 1(b)?\n   1. If not, could the petitioner instead be charged with Reckless Driving, as provided by title II of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 1(a)?\n      1. Does driving backwards show willful disregard for the safety of others?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. Yes. Allowing traffic misconduct even when it technically affects no one would be out of place compared to other parts of the Criminal Code and would make it unreasonably harder for traffic authorities to properly maintain the safe and efficient flow of traffic. **(PASSED)**\n2. No. As long as the driver is driving the correct way, pursuant to all traffic regulations provided by the traffic code, the driver is not guilty of careless driving. However, driving backwards constitutes reckless driving as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 1(a), as driving backwards is needlessly dangerous, and shows a willful disregard of others safety. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law, the board finds the defendant not guilty of careless driving as provided by the Foundation Code, title II., subsection 3 § 1(b). The board finds the defendant guilty of reckless driving as provided by the Foundation Code, title II., subsection 3 § 1(a) instead. The board sends the case back to the Military Police to issue a new punishment in accordance with the changes in charges. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 7 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. Winter_Selection - Aye\n2.

Case [24-005-10-D793](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19K8CHdgItFINrVF79M8LVVggpGonVdB9Tx2nV4W7CRE/edit?usp=sharing \"‌\") from 9th February 2024. The sentence was a 3 day Class E sentence. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Failing to comply with an installation protocol as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 2(a); Class C Misdemeanor\n   2. Unlawful discharge of a firearm as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 7(b); Class B Misdemeanor\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Does title II. of the Foundation Code, section 2 § 5(d), rule out the defendant’s criminal liability for their decision to leave Site Phi and attempt to return to Site Epsilon when they were ordered to do so by their test escorts, a Security Department Agent and a Crimson-9 task force Agent?\n2. Is there a reasonable doubt that the petitioner assumed the Military Police member was a Class-D?\n   1. It was Protocol Uproar during the commission of the crime.\n3. If the answer to point 2 is yes, was it reasonable of the defendant to act upon that assumption and shoot at the Military Police member?\n4. If the answers to points 2 and 3 is yes, does that absolve the defendant of criminal liability for firing at the Military Police officer in accordance with title II. of the Foundation Code, section 2 § 5(e)?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. In regards to point 1, the answer is yes. The Crimon-9 task force Agent, especially considering his role as the defendant's test escort and as a seasoned combative, is a person of authority as provided by the referenced criminal liability exception clause. **(PASSED)**\n2. The answer to points 2 and 3 is not yes.\n\n**Findings of Fact**\n\n1. The answer to point 2 is yes. - **(PASSED)**\n2. No. Firearm holders must be held to a higher standard, especially during such emergency situations. The defendant's use of the firearm in this situation was reckless. It is everyone's responsibility to take reasonable efforts to check what or who they're shooting at. The defendant did not take any such reasonable efforts. - **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law, the board finds the defendant not guilty of failing to comply with an installation protocol as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 2(a). The board upholds the Criminal Review Board's decision to find the defendant guilty of unlawful discharge of a firearm as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 7(b). The board sends the case back to the Criminal Review Board to issue a new punishment in accordance with the changes in charges. The board also asks the Criminal Review Board to consider the fact that the offense was committed recklessly, not knowingly or purposefully in their sentencing. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 6 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full majority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2.

         "desc":"### Information\n\n- **Petitioner’s ROBLOX Username:** d2holder\n- **Petitioner’s ROBLOX ID:** 3904995327\n- **Entity:** Criminal Review Board\n- **Type:** Appellate Order\n- **Reference Number:** AR-15:502-24\n- **Handling Officer:** Winter_Selection, on behalf of SoroLover123\n\n### Case\n\n1. Case [24-005-10-D390](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yWWE27B9NKk5GRdm2DgaEXRdkfNel2XRldA0WN4oGqc/edit \"‌\") from 7th February 2024. The sentence was a 5 day Class E suspension. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Failure to Comply as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 9(a); Class B Misdemeanor\n   2. Causing a Public Disturbance as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 2(c); Class C Misdemeanor\n\n### Case Elements\n\n1. Is the CRB's discretion in sentencing absolute as long as it is used consistently and in accordance with the Foundation Code?\n2. If the answer to point 1 is no, what are the mitigating and aggravating circumstances that should be considered when deciding the sentence, and what should be the sentence if there is absence of any such circumstances?\n   1. Does the treatment of a person(s) under detainment affect the severity of the sentence the Criminal Review Board should issue?\n      1. Were the following efforts, or the lack thereof, taken by the law enforcement authorities unreasonable?\n         1. Being killed by Military Police, after the petitioner refused to get off the road.\n         2. Being left sitting in a chair, cuffed, so that any Foundation Personnel could spectate the interrogation.\n         3. Not taking required precautions to prevent the petitioner from being killed by Class-D personnel.\n         4. Being teleported back to the Ethics Committee interrogation room via in-game admin commands.\n            1. If so, is a sentence reduction to a 2 day Class E sentence reasonable?\n3. Was the Criminal Review Board's decision in sentencing correct?\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Conclusions of Law**\n\n1. In regards to point 1, the answer is no. The Criminal Review Board's decisions on sentencing, which albeit may be legal and consistent, shall be subject to review by the Judicial Review Board if an appellate order is created. The Judicial Review Board serves as an appellate entity, a forum for those subject to an action to find justice in the case against them. In an effort to maintain a consistent criminal and justice system, the Judicial Review Board must, as the only and final appellate entity, maintain appellate jurisdiction over the Criminal Review Board's discretion in sentencing. **(PASSED)**\n2. A judicial authority with the discretion to issue multiple punishments or a punishment of various length shall:\n   1. consider the following as mitigating circumstances:\n      1. the offender confessed to the offense;\n      2. the offender committed the offense negligently;\n      3. the offender committed the offense out of lack of experience or knowledge;\n      4. the offender committed the offense because of poor or wrong understanding of the law;\n      5. the offender committed no criminal offenses before;\n      6. the nature of the offense suggested the applicability of a criminal liability exception without fully meeting its conditions;\n      7. the offender clearly demonstrated remorse and was fully compliant with law enforcement and judicial authorities; and\n   2. consider the following as aggravating circumstances:\n      1. the offender committed the offense purposefully or with premeditation or after previous deliberation;\n      2. the offender abused their power, standing, or position by committing the offense;\n      3. the offender committed the offense as a member of an organized group or conspiracy;\n      4. the offender was disrespectful or demonstrated contempt to law enforcement or judicial authorities or the judicial system in general; and\n   3. may further consider the following factors:\n      1. the extent of the offense, the amount of victims or specific acts, and the duration of the offense’s commission;\n      2. the interest of protecting the community against immoral and unacceptable conduct;\n      3. the interest of crime prevention by deterrence and rehabilitation; and\n      4. the interest of restoring justice, repairing or stopping the harm caused by the crime. **(PASSED)**\n3. The board finds no flaws in the Criminal Review Board's decision. Applying the guidelines from conclusion 1, the board believes that there are two aggravating circumstances to be considered in accordance with clauses i. and iv. of part 2 of that conclusion. Furthermore, the board believes that the interest of crime prevention by rehabilitation must be considered, whereas a lower crime would have a lower chance of sufficiently deterring the defendant from repeating such an offense in the future. The sentencing range is anywhere from a formal warning to a 6 day class E sentence, and so considering the specified circumstances, the board considers a 5 day class E sentence adequate. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Order**\n\nIn light of the conclusions of law, the board upholds the contested action. **(PASSED)**\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the first conclusion of law in accordance with rule 7 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. JaroCycle - Absent\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye\n2.

SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. JaroCycle - Absent\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye\n3. The Judicial Review Board decided on the third conclusion of law in accordance with rule 6 of subarticle 3(a) of the Board Procedure as follows (full majority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2.

Case [24-005-10-S302/01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JEBbaLhYh2Wqd5gen1iaP_WVzVq0yV9EP5_qqJOP0w4/edit \"‌\") from 23 February 2024. The sentence was a formal warning. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Trespassing as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 6(a), clause i.; Class C Misdemeanor\n   2. Criminal Interaction with the Pandora Crysta as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 5(a); Class C Misdemeanor\n\n### Petition\n\nThe petition may be found within the ticket records of the Ethics Committee, #2173.\n\n1. The petitioner has committed no other crimes than the case to be expunged, staying clear of any criminal liability for the past week.\n2. The petitioner has maintained an active commitment to the foundation within the last week, being an active member of the Security Department, playing for an hour a day.\n3. The petitioner had no disciplinary issues in the past week since their case.\n4. The petitioner believes the cause of the punishment to be their lack of knowledge of the legislative documents and Pandora range and believes that this was corrected, demonstrated by their progress to Security Agent within the Security Department, and them also stating that they did immediately review the legislative documents after the punishments.\n5. It may seem to have been far too short of a timeframe to effectively and adequately conclude that the petitioner had indeed improved after this crime.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Order**\n\nThe expungement request is denied. The board doesn't believe that the defendant sufficiently demonstrated a change in standards.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the order in accordance with subrule 4(b) of subarticle 3(c) of the Board Procedure, whereas the voting procedure has been adjusted in accordance with rule 8(c) of article 2 of the Board Procedure, as follows (full supermajority):\n   1.

The case presents the following charges:\n   1. 3 § 8(d) - Improper Interactions with Anomalies, interfering with Containment of an Anomaly\n   2. 5 § 4(i) - Obstruction of Justice\n\n### Petition\n\n1. The petitioner has committed more crimes since the case they are requesting expungement for, with the most recent one being committed in January 2024.\n2. The petitioner has maintained an active commitment to the foundation within the last 2 months, being a semi-active member of the Scientific Department.\n3. The petitioner had no disciplinary issues in their department the past month since their most recent case\n4. The petitioner believes the cause of the punishment to be their lack of knowledge on the rules of the Foundation, as they stated they were quite new and getting used to the rules and believes that this was corrected, demonstrated by their progress within the foundation, achieving the rank of Junior Researcher within the Scientific Department and the rank of Security Class-2.\n5. It should also be noted that a few weeks later, the clause and context of the breaching anomalies crime that the defendant committed was  made lawful.\n6. It seems that the petitioner has committed crimes frequently since this crime as evident by them having several dress code violations and a few failure to comply violations, due to them violating the dress code after being specifically warned to not do so, they have also had an Obstruction of Justice charge.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Order**\n\nThe expungement request is denied.

Case [24-005-10-C179/01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HxV6aww2kKPhOx-RFCjzSWEize25yVAOaHH6lP6bqeI/edit \"‌\") from 27th January 2024. The sentence was a formal warning. The case presents the following charges:\n   1. Trespassing as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 6(a), clause i.; Class C Misdemeanor\n   2. Improper Interactions with hostiles as provided by title II. of the Foundation Code, section 3 § 10(a); Class C Misdemeanor\n\n### Petition\n\n1. The petitioner has committed no other crimes than the case to be expunged, staying clear of any criminal liability for the past month\n2. The petitioner has not maintained an active commitment to the foundation within the last  month, being an inactive member of the Scientific Department, that has only passed their Entrant Orientation\n3. The petitioner had no disciplinary issues in the past month.\n4. The petitioner believes the cause of the punishment to be their lack of knowledge and believes that this was corrected, demonstrated by their progress within the foundation and lack of further criminal liability.  This can be further demonstrated by them receiving the rank of Security Class-2, often known as the most knowledagable low ranking Foundation Personnel.\n\n### Ruling\n\n**Order**\n\nThe expungement request is denied. The board doesn't believe that the defendant sufficiently demonstrated a change in standards because of their lack of active commitment since the crime.\n\n**Vote**\n\n1. The Judicial Review Board decided on the order in accordance with subrule 4(b) of subarticle 3(c) of the Board Procedure, whereas the voting procedure has been adjusted in accordance with rule 8(c) of article 2 of the Board Procedure, as follows (full supermajority):\n   1. Vasek_Stolba - Aye\n   2. SoroLover123 - Aye\n   3. ViscountSamuel - Aye\n   4. JaroCycle - Absent\n   5. Winter_Selection - Aye",
